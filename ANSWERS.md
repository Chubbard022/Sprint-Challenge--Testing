1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
    1. The Describe block helps keep the output of the unit testing organized.  Within the describe block should be a string describing the function that is being tested.The describe blocks can be nested within each other. The it block holds each test that is going to be ran given a certain functionality. The It block is where expected results occur and where we test for them.

1. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
    1. Test driven development allows for developers and stakeholders to work together in bridging expectations of how certain functionality should work. Testing is very verbose and easy to read what the code should do. Test driven Development ensures that things are working properly or that things are displaying correctly while they are being built out. It’s important to know that within test driven development that we write the tests out before the coding occurs. Test Driven Development tests small features to ensure that they are working the way they should

1. Mention three types of automated tests.
    1. Unit Testing
        1. Unit testing looks at several small units of code such as functions and methods and makes sure they work as expected
    2.  Integration Testing
        1. Integration testing takes server units of code and makes sure that they work together as expected
    3. End-To-End Testing
        1. The Whole application is tested within E2E testing. This type of testing creates a real life scenario of the project being deployed and used in real life. This type of testing is the most expensive and time consuming to do.
